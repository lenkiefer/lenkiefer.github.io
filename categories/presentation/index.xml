      <description>The 100 second crisis About 100 seconds into every talk I give there comes a crisis.
This note is about that crisis and how I try to overcome it. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where you give a presentation or speech-I call them &amp;ldquo;talks&amp;rdquo;-you might experience your own 100 second crisis. Perhaps my strategy could work for you.
The first 99 seconds Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with those first 99 seconds when things are going well.</description>

      <description>I GIVE A LOT OF TALKS. Some are formal presentations or keynotes to large groups, while many are in small group settings. Sometimes I get impromptu requests so I have to be ready pretty much at all times to give some sort of talk.
On this blog I’ve shared many different DATA VISUALIZATIONS which could be part of a talk. Many of the more complex visualizations-probably most of the animated gifs-wouldn’t work great in most presentation settings.</description>

      <description>IF YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING along-welcome if you’re stopping by for the first time-you’ll have seen many different data visualizations that I have shared with you. But let’s take a step back and consider what to do with them. I’ve got several thoughts on this topic that I will collect in a series I’ll call “See Data, Speak Data”.
See Data, Speak Data“See Data, Speak Data” was the title I gave to a keynote I recently gave to some analysts about how I use data in my professional life.</description>
