      <description>ALL RIGHT! LOOKS LIKE WE’RE BACK ONLINE.
I took the opportunity to try out the newly released blogdown R package and migrate my blog over from Jekyll to Hugo.
This blog has been up for just over two years and Jekyll was working fine, but I never felt really comfortable. I’m guessing that the Blogdown package will become enormously popular and it seems that Hugo has more flexibility for me. Also, Blogdown and Rstudio integrate better with Hugo than Jekyll.</description>
