      <description>ALL RIGHT! LOOKS LIKE WE’RE BACK ONLINE.
I took the opportunity to try out the newly released blogdown R package and migrate my blog over from Jekyll to Hugo.
This blog has been up for just over two years and Jekyll was working fine, but I never felt really comfortable. I’m guessing that the Blogdown package will become enormously popular and it seems that Hugo has more flexibility for me. Also, Blogdown and Rstudio integrate better with Hugo than Jekyll.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO REWORK SOME VISUALIZATIONS we’ve already made.
Inspired by this compendium of clean graphics in R, I want to remake some of visualizations we made earlier this year in a low-key manner.
Sometimes the visualizations we make here can be pretty intense. Sometimes they are quite intricate, or use animation, or have a lot going on with them. But sometimes you need a simple, low-key visualization to make your point.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST WE WILL STUDY FORECASTS OF US ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.
Niels Bohr quipped:
Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.
I’m a macroeconomist by training, and my day job sometimes requires me to forecast the future so I can relate. Predicting the future can be quite difficult.
In this post, we’ll analyze forecasts of economic conditions from professional forecasters using R to wrangle the data and construct plots.</description>

      <description>THIS POST IS A QUICK FOLLOW UP to my previous post on forecasting.
I’m not going to add any R code or commentary on graphics, instead I’m just going to leave a few extra graphs related to the prior post. Check out the earlier post for more details on the data and how to build the charts.

      <description>I HAVE BEEN BUILDING SOME NEW VISUALIZATIONS to study house price trends. In particular I have been thinking about rates of change of rates of change, or accelerations and decelerations in house price trends. I’ve got more to say on this topic, but for today, let’s create a few visualizations and contemplate an animation.
Per usual we’ll use R to create some plots.

      <description>The 100 second crisis About 100 seconds into every talk I give there comes a crisis.
This note is about that crisis and how I try to overcome it. If you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where you give a presentation or speech-I call them &amp;ldquo;talks&amp;rdquo;-you might experience your own 100 second crisis. Perhaps my strategy could work for you.
The first 99 seconds Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with those first 99 seconds when things are going well.</description>

      <description>I LIKE TO MAKE ANIMATED GIFS with my data. But frankly, sometimes they can be confusing. I got a good suggestion via twitter in response to a gif I shared there:
This is very cool. Has anyone added a visual “progress bar” to a gganimate loop to show the frame visually? It&#39;s hard to grasp time as text.— Jonathan Spring (@JustTheSpring) August 6, 2017Now it’s very likely that others have tried this, but I haven’t seen it.</description>

      <description>IT IS TIME FOR AN UPDATE ON HOUSE PRICE TRENDS AROUND THE UNITED STATES.
I have been experimenting with some new visualizations and updating some old favorites. Let’s collect them here.
This post will be an extension of my Visual Meditations on House Prices series from last year. Check out those posts for additional visualizations.
DataWe’ll use the recently updated Freddie Mac House Price Index (link to source) data and use R to create some plots.</description>

      <description>I LOOK AT A LOT OF DATA and the thing about data is it’s not always what it seems to be. A lot of data are uncertain, and based on estimates.
We’ve talked about this before. See for example, this post on visualizing uncertainty in housing data. In this post I’m going to combine one of my favorite new plot types, the joyplot (see this post) with another of my favorite plot types: the beeswarm plot (see this post for more on beeswarm plots).</description>

      <description>THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET A BIT MORE ABSTRACT IN THIS SPACE. Today we make some Kandinsky-style images with R.
This summer I was fortunate to spend some time at the Pompidou Centre in Paris. The Pompidou Centre houses the largest collection of modern art in Europe. I really enjoyed their collection of abstract and minimalist paintings.
Well, turns out we can make our own abstract-style art using a Kandinsky R package from Giora Simchoni.</description>

      <description>I TOOK SOME TIME OFF OVER THE SUMMER, away from data visualizations. It’s good to get away from time to time, but oh boy did I miss out.
I wasn’t gone long, but in the short time I was gone people came up with some wonderful things.
Let me dive back into it with some joyful dataviz.
Joy plotsClaus Wilke (Twitter) authored a new R package for creating joy plots ( LINK for ggjoy vignette).</description>

      <description>LET US FOLLOW UP ON YESTERDAY’S POST with some more analysis of housing affordability.
Per usual, we’ll use R to generate the plots and I’ll share the code below.
Measuring affordabilityFirst, let’s talk a little bit more about what we are seeing in the plots. What are we measuring? Affordability metrics are often based on market level summary statistics. In our case we are looking at various ways to measure housing costs at a market level.</description>

      <description>HOW IS YOUR SUMMER GOING? Well okay, it’s not summer yet, but it sure is hot around where I am. Haven’t posted recently, so I’m going to share a couple of visualizations.
Per usual, we’ll use R to generate the plots and I’ll share the code below.
Visualizing affordabilityLast week the Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) of Harvard University released their annual State of the Nation’s Housing report. The report is full of useful information about housing markets in the United States.</description>

      <description>I MADE A LITTLE TABLEAU VISUALIZATION TO ANLAYZE TRENDS in population, housing supply and house prices.
If you like interactive dataviz, then the best thing might be to jump down below and explore. But I’ll frame the viz with a bit of discussion.
This post extends the analysis from last time looking at population, housing supply and house prices. Last time we restricted ourselves to national trends, but here we’ll dig into local trends.</description>

      <description>QUITE A LOT OF HOUSING DATA CAME OUT THIS WEEK. Let’s recap with some graphs.
Mortgage rates back below 4 percentThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell back below 4 percent this week.
New home salesNew home sales data was released and came in weaker than expected for April 2017. March has been an extremely strong number, so a decline was anticipated, but the drop was bigger than most expected.</description>

      <description>SO WE HAVE BEEN PLOTTING A LOT OF INDEX VALUES LATELY. It’s been great. But you have questions. Great questions.
I got an interesting response to my house price dot chart over Twitter regarding the house price index we were plotting. User [@chrisschnabel](https://twitter.com/chrisschnabel) wondered how the choice of starting point influenced how the house price dot chart looked.
@lenkiefer This is a great viz, but conclusions will be drawn based on the date of the index.</description>

      <description>TIME TO TRY OUT ANOTHER HOUSE PRICE VISUALIZATION.
In this post we’ll try out a new way to visualize recent house price trends with R.
Just this wekeend I saw a new package geofacet for organizing ggplot2 facets along a geographic grid. It allows use to construct a small multiple graph that roughly looks like the United States. (Thanks to [@yoniceedee](https://twitter.com/yoniceedee) for recommending geofacet).
Let’s try it out using the same house price data we visualized recently.</description>

As usual we’ll use R to generate the plots and I’ll share the code below. But before we get into the details of constructing the charts, let’s just look at two plots to help set the stage.</description>

      <description>TIME FOR A NEW HOUSE PRICE VISUALIZATIONS.
In this post I’ll new way to visualize recent house price trends with R.
DataWe’re going to be visualizing the Freddie Mac House Price Index. We talked about these data earlier this month, see this post for some other visualizations.
You can download the Excel spreadsheet with state house price index values here. Note that this code is based on the release with data through March, 2017, future releases may shift the exact location of the cells.</description>

      <description>HOUSING DATA ARE OFTEN MEASURED WITH CONSIDERABLE uncertainty. Estimates are usually based on small samples that are subject to sampling variability. The various government statistical agencies usually report estimates of uncertainty with their releases. For example, both the New Residential Construction and New Residential Sales reports include estimates of sampling uncertainty along with their point estimates.
In this post I want to explore ways to visualize sampling uncertainty with R. I am reminded of article from a the New York Times Upshot blog a few years ago.</description>

We’ll use the same data as yesterday and create a combined scatterplot with bivariate choropleth map and animate it with R.
Let’s get right to it.
Load dataWe’ll follow from yesterday and load our data and do some manipulations.
In order for this to work we’ll need data from three sources:

IN THIS POST I WANT TO REVISIT SOME MAPS I MADE LAST YEAR. At that time, I was using Tableau to create choropleth maps, but in this post I want to reimagine the maps and make them in R.
Last year in this post we looked at the relationship between population growth and the growth in housing units from 2010 to 2015.</description>

      <description>TIME FOR ANOTHER DATAVIZ REMIX. Saw on Twitter that [@hrbrmstr](https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr) posted a remix of a Wall Street Journal visualization over at rud.is.
The original WSJ article used pies of various size to compare recent store closings.
As we usually do in this space, we’ll use R to create our plots.
Let’s mix things up and go remix the remix.
PiesBut first let’s consider the original.
I’m not going to copy the original from the WSJ (click the link above to check out the story), but I am going to make my own pie version.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO SHARE SOME R data wrangling strategy and use it to prepare an update to some global house price plots I shared last year.
In last year’s post I did some data manipulation by hand and mouse in Excel before getting into R. In this post I’m going to use the newly updated readxl library to do the data manipulations entirely in R. If you follow along, then you should be able to use this code to recreate my graphs.</description>

      <description>IN 2016 HOUSING IN THE UNITED STATES HAD ITS BEST YEAR IN A DECADE (see my review or my flexdashboard remix) and so far 2017 has gotten off to a good start. Let’s take a look at residential construction, particularly housing starts and see how they stack up to prior years.
Per usual we will use R, and the libraries of data.table() and the tidyverse for data management and plotting, and animation and tweenr for animating.</description>

      <description>LET’S PIXELATE AMERICA. This morning I happened across a fun blog post on how to generate Pixel maps with R via R weekly.
The basic code is so easy, all you need is ggplot2 (which I get from the tidyverse).

      <description>BACK IN JANUARY WE LOOKED AT HOUSING microdata from the American Community Survey Public Microdata that we collected from IPUMS. Let’s pick back up and look at these data some more. Glad you could join us.
Be sure to check out my earlier post for more discussion of the underlying data. Here we’ll pick up where we left off and make some more graphs using R.
Just a quick reminder (read the earlier post for all the details), we have a dataset that includes household level observations for the 20 largest metro areas in the United States for 2010 and 2015 (latest data available).</description>

I was putting together a presentation using remark.js via the xaringan R package (see my discussion of how to do this in this post) and decided to try a dark theme. The code below, modifies our mortgage rate code to make this graph:</description>

Nope, it was a tile plot.
We’re going to make the plot with R. As before, we’ll use data we used in our mortgage rate post to explore weekly average mortgage rates in the United States based on Freddie Mac’s Primary Mortgage Market Survey.</description>

      <description>THIS PAST MONTH HAS BEEN BUSY. People have been traveling, I’ve been traveling, kids have been sick, and we’ve had the March Madness basketball keeping me occupied. Today I wanted to just explore a little analysis I’ve put together on resampling.
Because reasons I’ve recently been interested in sample sizes and how quickly certain estimates might converge.
There is of course, a vast literature on this topic. But armed with powerful computers maybe we can avoid too much mathy work and try to simulate our way through some problems.</description>

      <description>IN LATE 2016 HOUSE PRICES recovered back to their pre-recession peak. At least nationally. At least not adjusted for inflation. Let’s talk about it.
National trendsThe chart below shows the Freddie Mac House Price Index (link to source) for the United States from December 2000 to December 2016.
Prior to the Great Recession, house prices reached their seasonally-adjusted peak in March of 2007. Prices fell from 2007 (with a brief interruption due to the first time homebuyer tax credit) to December 2011 when they reached their post-recession minimum.</description>

      <description>THERE IS A LOVELY BOOK on writing style called “Clear and Simple as the Truth” by Francis-Noël Thomas and Mark Turner (webpage). In it Thomas and Turner distinguish between several writing styles including practical style and classic style. Practical style’s mode is description, while classic style’s is presentation (see description).
It strikes me that a similar distinction could be made when exploring statistics. Often, when we are exploring data we are in description mode.</description>

As an alternative, I have been exploring using flexdashboards for R. One advantage of flexdashboards is that you can easily incorporate R code into the design of dashboards.

      <description>THOUGH 2016 IS NOT OVER YET I want to get a jump on my 2017 resolution: make better tables.
I’ve been re-reading this paper on the Rudiments of Numeracy by A. S. C. Ehrenberg published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society in 1977. Though the paper is nearly 40 years old, it still offers some valuable insights.
This little post makes a simple table displaying monthly averages for 30-year fixed mortgage rates.</description>

      <description>I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU a little bit of code to make this whimsical data visualization:
Make a simple mapFirst we can construct a map of the lower 48 U.S. states and add a marker for each city. These data are available in the us.cities data that come with the maps package.

      <description>Animations with tweenrIN THIS POST WE ARE GOING TO CREATE TWO SIMPLE animated data visualizations using R ggplot2, animation, and tweenr packages.
See this post about tweenr for an introduction to tweenr, and more examples here and here.
Unlike those examples we are going to create visualizations using the data that ship with the tidyverse packages (mainly ggplot2). This will allow for easier replication.

      <description>IN THIS POST WE’RE GOING TO REVISE the dotplot code I posted that lets you take the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) projections and turn them into an animated dotplot.
The problem is that the code I posted was for projections through June 2016 that only provided annual projections for 2016, 2017, and 2018, but the FOMC added 2019 in their September and December 2016 projections.
My original code was hard coded to only handle projections for 3 years and longer-run and now a 4th year was added.</description>

      <description>IntroductionTHE GREAT THING ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA is that it helps put me in contact with people from around the world. I started up a conversation with Twitter user @benmyers29 who shared some recent trends in Canadian housing markets.
89% of Canadians have more than 25% equity in their homes. Avg equity ratio is 74%. Nearly 40% of Canadians have their homes fully paid off. pic.twitter.com/mAfkO38Kg2— Big Ben Myers (@benmyers29) December 8, 2016@benmyers29 pointed out that homeowner equity in Canada was quite high, with only about 1% of Canadian mortgaged residential properties underwater (where the mortgage amount is greater than the property value so homeowner equity is negative) per this report referenced in the tweet.</description>

Among other things Hadley talks about the idea of nesting data frames, models and model results within a data frame. That idea struck me as something that could be quite useful and not at all something that could lead to explosive increase in the size of data frames or unending loops.</description>

      <description>SOMETIMES YOU ACTUALLY LEARN SOMETHING from social media. Today on Twitter I happened across this Tweet via @kyle_e_walker:
Anybody want population estimates for every US county &amp;amp; metro back to 1790? Well, here are mine. Have fun!https://t.co/QqdA6226kN
&amp;mdash; Jonathan Schroeder (@j_p_schroeder) August 15, 2016 
Seems somebody posted estimates of the U.S. population by county (defined by 2010 county definitions) going back to 1790. This is a perfect dataset to practice my mapping with R.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO DOCUMENT some R code I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on combining maps and distribution plots. As I discussed earlier lots of interesting data will be released in the fall and I want to be ready for it.
Some of these snippets can be recycled when the new data is available.
Maps One area of data visualization with R I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored much is mapping. Part of this reason is because I&amp;rsquo;ve had other tools to use, but usually it&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m in a hurry.</description>

Existing and new home sales came out, the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University released their annual State of the Nation&amp;rsquo;s Housing, and the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (the Brexit). We&amp;rsquo;ll recap these data and events through charts I&amp;rsquo;ve created and shared throughout the week.

As far as celebrity charts go, the dot plot has to be up there. Check out how much &amp;ldquo;dot plot&amp;rdquo; has grown in search popularity since the Fed introduced their dot plot in 2012:
Ultimately, it will look something like this:
The dot plot is a special chart that shows the distribution of expectations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the federal funds rate.</description>

      <description>A dataviz remix I came across some interesting analysis from Josh Lehner at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis about the &amp;ldquo;Housing Trilemma&amp;rdquo;.
The Housing Trilemma, captured in the chart below is based on the following claim:
 Every city wants to have a strong local economy, high quality of life and housing affordability for its residents. Unfortunately these three dimensions represent the Housing Trilemma. A city can achieve success on two but not all three at the same time.</description>

Housing unit growth One key factor driving housing market dynamics is the expansion of housing supply (or lack thereof). The updated estimates from Census allow us to see which areas have added the most housing units and how that relates to population and house price trends.</description>

The big news was that the FOMC still considered a June rate hike a possibility. How much does Fed policy impact mortgage rates?

And here&amp;rsquo;s a still image of the same data:

Making a data viz SOMETIMES ANIMATION CAN BE USEFUL, though it is often misused. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking the week-to-week changes in mortgage rates, and animating with a GIF.
Example animated gif with mortgage rates from 1/1/2013 to 3/10/2016 I build my gif using the R statistical package.
Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more of the details later, but the R code below uses the ggplot2, ggthemes and animation packages to create the plots, style them, and save the animation.</description>

Will builders maintain their sunny outlook? The HMI is a diffusion index based on survey questions about homebuilder’s attitudes. Values of the index above 50 indicate that on balance, more respondents feel positive than negative about the current conditions in and direction of the single-family housing market.</description>
