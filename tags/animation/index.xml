      <description>IN THIS POST WE WILL STUDY FORECASTS OF US ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.
Niels Bohr quipped:
Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.
I’m a macroeconomist by training, and my day job sometimes requires me to forecast the future so I can relate. Predicting the future can be quite difficult.
In this post, we’ll analyze forecasts of economic conditions from professional forecasters using R to wrangle the data and construct plots.</description>

      <description>THIS POST IS A QUICK FOLLOW UP to my previous post on forecasting.
I’m not going to add any R code or commentary on graphics, instead I’m just going to leave a few extra graphs related to the prior post. Check out the earlier post for more details on the data and how to build the charts.

      <title>Adding an animation progress bar</title>

      <description>I LIKE TO MAKE ANIMATED GIFS with my data. But frankly, sometimes they can be confusing. I got a good suggestion via twitter in response to a gif I shared there:
This is very cool. Has anyone added a visual “progress bar” to a gganimate loop to show the frame visually? It&#39;s hard to grasp time as text.— Jonathan Spring (@JustTheSpring) August 6, 2017Now it’s very likely that others have tried this, but I haven’t seen it.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST I WANT TO EXTEND ON yesterday’s post and build an animated bivariate choropleth.
We’ll use the same data as yesterday and create a combined scatterplot with bivariate choropleth map and animate it with R.
Let’s get right to it.
Load dataWe’ll follow from yesterday and load our data and do some manipulations.
In order for this to work we’ll need data from three sources:

      <description>Animations with tweenrIN THIS POST WE ARE GOING TO CREATE TWO SIMPLE animated data visualizations using R ggplot2, animation, and tweenr packages.
See this post about tweenr for an introduction to tweenr, and more examples here and here.
Unlike those examples we are going to create visualizations using the data that ship with the tidyverse packages (mainly ggplot2). This will allow for easier replication.

Mortgage Rates in 2016 This chart shows the weekly average for the 30-year fixed rate morrtgage.
Comparing mortgage rates by week This viz compares weekly mortgage rates (30-year fixed rate mortgage) by year. Each line represents a different year. The x-axis display the week of the year (from 1 to 52).

      <description>IT WAS A BUSY WEEK FOR ECONOMIC AND HOUSING DATA this week. Below are some data visaulizations I made tracking key trends in economic and housing market data.
Homeowner equity increases to $12.7 Trillion in the second quarter of 2016 With house prices rising by nearly 6 percent on a year-over-year basis, homeowners are building back equity. According to the Federal Reserve&amp;rsquo;s Flow of Funds, owners&amp;rsquo; equity in real estate was $12.</description>

      <description>IN MY PREVIOUS POST we looked at the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data and plotted a Beveridge Curve. In this post I want to add some more code that allows us to plot Beveridge Curves by industry.
For more on the analysis of industry-specific Beveridge Curves, see this paper published in the June 2012 Monthly Labor Review that decomposes shifts in the Beveridge Curve and looks at it by industry.</description>

The post got many responses, some observing that while student debt has grown a lot the absolute level of it is small relative to mortgage debt.</description>

      <description>IN THIS POST WE&amp;rsquo;RE GOING to make an animated version of the famous Federal Reserve dot plot comparing the dots in March 2016 to June 2016. As far as celebrity charts go, the dot plot has to be up there. Check out how much &amp;ldquo;dot plot&amp;rdquo; has grown in search popularity since the Fed introduced their dot plot in 2012:
Ultimately, it will look something like this:
The dot plot is a special chart that shows the distribution of expectations of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the federal funds rate.</description>

      <description>A dataviz remix I came across some interesting analysis from Josh Lehner at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis about the &amp;ldquo;Housing Trilemma&amp;rdquo;.
The Housing Trilemma, captured in the chart below is based on the following claim:
 Every city wants to have a strong local economy, high quality of life and housing affordability for its residents. Unfortunately these three dimensions represent the Housing Trilemma. A city can achieve success on two but not all three at the same time.</description>

For this data I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the National Income and Products Accounts from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Specifically we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at the contributions to growth in Real Gross Domstic Product, which you can find here.</description>

      <description>YESTERDAY THE FEDERAL RESERVE RELEASED minutes from their last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in April. The big news was that the FOMC still considered a June rate hike a possibility. How much does Fed policy impact mortgage rates? I put together a few gifs comparing the history of the 30-year mortgage rate, the Fed Funds rate and the 10-year constant maturity Treasury.

Let&amp;rsquo;s pause the animation and look at the last frame:
This plot shows the distribution of metro area unemployment. These data are available here.
Each dot represents a metro area with its unemployment rate depicted on the x axis. The data are bucketed into 0.25 percentage point buckets and stacked when more than one metro falls within that range.</description>

Making a data viz SOMETIMES ANIMATION CAN BE USEFUL, though it is often misused. I&amp;rsquo;ve been tracking the week-to-week changes in mortgage rates, and animating with a GIF.
Example animated gif with mortgage rates from 1/1/2013 to 3/10/2016 I build my gif using the R statistical package.
Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll explain more of the details later, but the R code below uses the ggplot2, ggthemes and animation packages to create the plots, style them, and save the animation.</description>
